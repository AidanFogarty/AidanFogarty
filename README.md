### Hi there 👋

Hi! I’m Aidan and I am a software engineer based in Ireland. I currently work at Arcane, a small but growing team on a mission to building the platform for all things growth. I love Python, Go and building things with serverless tools. 

An avid surfer 🏄 and a big fan of formula 1 🏎️
